[justify]This is a good place to write a general blurb about the house/building. Generally details that go in this section are things like what the outside and grounds look like, how big the house is, and a general idea of it's vibe and the people who live in it. It's generally a good idea to keep this section as a summary, so a paragraph or two, and take things more in depths in the other areas.
