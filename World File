[justify]This is a spot to give a little general overview of this world. What are some of the things a new visitor would notice first? What are its defining features, its hazards-- what makes it unique? Is this a single planet or an entire universe that our agents would have access to? Are there space faring races, or is it relatively low tech? Maybe there's magic instead? Give us the rundown of what agents should expect.[/justify] 

[font=Agency FB][size=5][color=#32a3ac]Tech Level[/color][/size][/font]
The scale is from 0 (no technology at all) to 5 (a high level of technology permeates every aspect of life). Staff will set the graphic for you once you tell us the level.

[justify][size=4][font=Agency FB][b][color=#ff7e79]Gate Status:[/color][/b][/font][/size] Security Level (insert security level required to access this world)
[size=2][i][color=#ffffff]The security level of a world is based on the dangers that may be encountered. You can find out more about agent security levels [url=https://www.rprepository.com/g/aotm/13724]here[/url], but there are five levels. Level Zero means that it is a location designated for recreational travel, which is something that must be discussed with staff first, as very few locations are by nature safe for just anyone to visit. Level five is usually reserved for extremely dangerous or completely corrupted worlds. This spot this text is occupying is usually reserved for a short blurb/explanation of the world's security level.[/color][/i][/size][/justify]
